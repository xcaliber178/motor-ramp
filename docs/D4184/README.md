This board is sold via Amazon as a "Trigger Switch Drive Board 0-20KHz PWM" and various other titles. It is essentially a N-MOS breakout board. Literally functions as an n-channel mosfet with terminal lugs. And a spare terminal.

Inputs and Outputs:
- Vin(-) and J1(-) of the input are electrically common and are the "Source" of the mosfet. 
- TRIG / PWM J1 input goes to the "Gate" of the mosfet. There is a resistor between the input and the shared fet's Gate inputs.
- Vout(-) is the "Drain" output of the mosfet board. 
- Note that the Vin+ and Vout+ exist solely as a terminal connection; these "+" connections are not used anywhere else on the board. This should be made far more obvious on the silkscreen.

Interestingly, the boards all have slightly different silk screen and different "part numbers" on the bottom in the center. Examples N-MOS, Z-MOS, XY-MOS
